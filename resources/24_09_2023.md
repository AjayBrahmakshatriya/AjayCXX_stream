2. GNU Win32: A package for running familiar GNU commands like grep, find, awk etc on Windows (cmd): [GNU Win32](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/)
3. Handy .bashrc snippet to make sure you don't close the terminal with background jobs. Useful if adopting my vim + ctrlz + fg workflow
```
exit() {
	if [[ $(jobs) == "" ]]; then
		command exit;
	else
		echo "You have stopped jobs!";
	fi
}
```

4. Enabling vi bindings in bash and customizing it a bit. Bind ctrl+l to familiar clear-screen and disable the v command (opens the current command in a vim buffer)
```
set -o vi
bind -m vi-insert "\C-l":clear-screen
bind -m vi-command "v":""
```

5. ctags: A tool for easier code navigation in vim (mostly for C and C++). The version I use is called [Universal Ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags)
